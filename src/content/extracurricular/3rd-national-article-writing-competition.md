# 3rd National Article Writing Competition

As a participant in the 3rd National Article Writing Competition organized by the Journal and Seminar Committee at UC Law, I authored a research article examining the intersection of emerging technology and existing legal frameworks.

## Competition Details

- **Date:** December 2024
- **Format:** Submission of a 3,000-word article on contemporary legal issues
- **Scope:** National level with participants from more than 50 law schools across India

## My Contribution

My article focused on the regulatory challenges posed by artificial intelligence in the legal sector, particularly addressing issues of:

- Legal liability in AI-assisted decision making
- Intellectual property rights for AI-generated content
- Ethical considerations in the use of predictive justice systems

This experience significantly enhanced my legal research skills and ability to critically analyze complex legal issues within the context of technological innovation.
