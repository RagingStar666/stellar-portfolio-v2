A comprehensive certificate course that explored the fundamental principles of intellectual property rights (IPR) and their management in various contexts. The program covered:

- Introduction to different forms of intellectual property: patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets
- Legal frameworks governing intellectual property rights at national and international levels
- Strategic management of intellectual property assets in business contexts
- Enforcement mechanisms and dispute resolution in IP conflicts
- Current trends and developments in intellectual property law

This course provided me with a solid foundation in understanding how intellectual property rights function within legal and business ecosystems, which is particularly valuable for my interest in IP law and its intersection with technology and creative industries.
