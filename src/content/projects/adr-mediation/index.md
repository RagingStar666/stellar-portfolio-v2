A specialized course focused on developing practical skills in Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) with a specific emphasis on mediation techniques. The program included:

- Theoretical foundations of mediation as an ADR mechanism
- Structure and stages of the mediation process
- Strategies for effective communication in conflict scenarios
- Ethical considerations and best practices for mediators
- Practical exercises and simulated mediation sessions

This course enhanced my ability to approach disputes from a solution-oriented perspective, develop empathetic listening skills, and facilitate productive conversations between conflicting parties. It complemented my academic legal education with practical skills that are increasingly valued in legal practice, especially as courts worldwide encourage alternative resolution methods to reduce litigation burden.
