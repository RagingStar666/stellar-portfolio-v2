My legal internship experiences have provided valuable opportunities to apply classroom knowledge in professional settings, focusing on legal research and writing:

- **Jus Scriptum (Remote)** - Legal Research & Writing Intern (December 2024 – January 2025)
  Conducted in-depth legal research and contributed to legal articles focusing on constitutional developments and intellectual property jurisprudence in India.

- **Jus Corpus (Remote)** - Legal Writing Intern (January – February 2025)
  Wrote analytical pieces on legal developments and case law summaries for publication on an open-access legal platform.

These internships developed my ability to:
- Research complex legal topics using professional databases and resources
- Analyze primary and secondary legal sources including case law, statutes, and scholarly articles
- Write clear, concise, and accurately cited legal content for both specialist and general audiences
- Work within professional publication workflows and editorial standards

The experience gained through these internships has strengthened my foundation in legal research methodologies and professional writing, while also providing insight into specific areas of law including constitutional development and intellectual property.
