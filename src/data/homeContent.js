  aboutMe: `
I'm a first-year B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at the University of Calcutta, passionate about the intersection of law, technology, and dispute resolution. With a keen interest in intellectual property rights, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and the evolving landscape of legal technology, I am committed to developing a multifaceted approach to legal practice.

My academic journey has been enriched by active participation in the Journal and Seminar Committee, where I contribute to legal scholarship and engage with contemporary legal issues. I have also been involved in legal writing competitions and mediation events, which have helped me develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

As I progress in my legal education, I aim to explore specialized areas of law while maintaining a holistic understanding of legal principles. My goal is to become a versatile legal professional capable of navigating complex legal challenges in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.
