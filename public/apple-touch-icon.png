# Apple Touch Icon

This file has been replaced with an SVG version (apple-touch-icon.svg) for better quality rendering.

If you want to convert this to a PNG for older device support, use a tool like ImageMagick:
`convert -background none -size 180x180 public/apple-touch-icon.svg public/apple-touch-icon.png`

Recommended size: 180x180 pixels
